# Nissyen Arts - Picture Gallery

After the digital business card I want to show everybody some pictures my brother did. 

## The problem

The Gallery should be responsive with cards (pictures and text in them) and the navigation should work with anchors. There should be some hovering animation and by clicking, a window should be opened to see the picture in a bigger size.

Working on this Website, I discovered a lot of issues I was not able to solve or to work on so far:
- Navigation for the mobile view needs to be animated or something to see the three navigation points
- Anchor are not set yet
- horizontal scrollbar is not disappearing
- inside the cards, the images and "links" are not the same sizes
- I will need to dive deeper into the "Modal" theory to get it done correctly
- footer still needs some styling and I have to get to know, what should all be a part of it
- work on the "color world"
